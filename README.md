# emapped
eMapped is a web application that helps people to manage their photos easily. It gives them information on how they felt on the day and helps them know where they took that photo. It also gives relevant hashtags for the objects found in the picture - this is really useful for tagging photos for instagram or other platforms. The website also has a world map view where you can see all of your pictures scattered all over the map. The profile page helps you to know how many photos you have, to know where is the most visited country of yours and other information.
